Repository Name: SQLproject.winequality

Description:
This repository contains SQL scripts and queries for analyzing the wine quality datasets. The datasets consist of two csv files: red and white wines from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality. The repository provides SQL scripts to explore, analyze, and derive insights from these datasets.

The SQL scripts cover various aspects of data retrieval, data filtering and manipulation, data aggregation, joins and relationships, and data modification. These scripts can be used to perform exploratory data analysis, calculate summary statistics, identify relationships between variables, and derive meaningful insights about the wine quality.

The repository includes SQL queries for retrieving sample records, filtering data based on specific conditions, aggregating data for statistical analysis, performing joins to establish relationships, and modifying data through insertions, updates, and deletions.

The scripts are designed to work with the "winequality_red" and "winequality_white" tables with the following columns:
   1 - fixed acidity
   2 - volatile acidity
   3 - citric acid
   4 - residual sugar
   5 - chlorides
   6 - free sulfur dioxide
   7 - total sulfur dioxide
   8 - density
   9 - pH
   10 - sulphates
   11 - alcohol
   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
